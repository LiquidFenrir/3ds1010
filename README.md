# 3ds1010
Port of [1010!](http://1010ga.me/) to 3ds homebrew, made in C.  
It's like Tetris but with infinite time, you lose when you can no longer place any of the pieces you have available.  
  
Made out of text for now, will use images and colors later on. Maybe it will even have themes (unlockables?)  

# Instructions
Use the D-PAD to move your cursor and select where to place the highlighted piece.  
Use the L/R shoulder buttons to select which piece you want to place.  
Press A to place the highlighted piece, Y to reset (if you're stuck, or want to start over), or START to quit.  
It doesnt currently tell you when you lost (are unable to place any of your pieces), so keep a sharp eye.
